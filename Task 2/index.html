                    <b>Lata Mangeshkar</b>, also known as the <em>'Nightingale of India'</em>, was one of the most
                    versatile singers in the Indian film industry. Lata was born on September 28, 1929, to classical
                    singer and theatre artist Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar and Shevanti in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Her
                    father started teaching her music at an early age. By the time she was five, Lata was seen
                    participating as an actress in plays written by her father. Her siblings - Meena, Asha, Usha, and
                    Hridaynath - are all accomplished singers and musicians.

                    In a career spanning nearly eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing voice for a bevy of
                    Bollywood leading ladies. She lent her voice to over 5,000 songs in over a thousand Hindi and 36
                    regional films. She had an unprecedented impact on Indian film music. Since 1942, Lata pushed back
                    the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling skills. Over the years, Lata had sung for actresses
                    from Madhubala to Priyanka Chopra. Best known for her versatile voice quality, she recorded albums
                    of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc).

                    She had worked with several legendary music directors including Madan Mohan, R D Burman, the duo
                    Laxmikant-Pyarelal and A R Rahman. She teamed up with Madan Mohan for the 1960s like Aap Ki Nazron
                    Ne Samjha from Anpadh, Lag Jaa Gale and Naina Barse Rim Jhim from Woh Kaun Thi?. Lata had sung over
                    700 songs for Laxmikant-Pyarelal, which include Mere Naseeb Mein from Naseeb and Sheesha Ho Ya Dil
                    Ho from Asha.

                The book entitled "Lata Mangeshkar: A Musical Journey" contains little known facts intertwined with the
                story of her life in music, struggles, successes and her reign as the Queen of Hindi music from the
                1940s to the present day.
